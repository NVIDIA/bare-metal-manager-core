## Scheduled Testing

The goal of this scheduled testing is to flag any significant issues in the
latest carbide trunk build.
It regularly deploys the latest site-controller to a real site and runs
an E2E Machine Lifecycle Test as well as some Cloud API sanity tests.

Scheduled pipelines are defined in GitLab
[here](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/pipeline_schedules).

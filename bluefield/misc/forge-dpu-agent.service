# We always want to restart the dpu agent in case of crashes
# However we don't want to immediatly restart it to avoid flooding the API server
# with bad requests which could limit the availablity of other clients.
# Note that we initially experimented with the `StartLimitIntervalSec`
# and `StartLimitBurst` parameters for this. However we learned that those policies
# prevented the service from **ever** restarting once the give threshold was
# exceeded. This required manual actions to enable the agent. The current policy
# will continuously restart the agent.

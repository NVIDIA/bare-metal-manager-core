# New or bored
## Still needs documentation

If you're new or bored, feel free to do one of these:

- How to configure libvirt for qemu based PXE booting on EFI
- How to configure DHCP relay to the docker-compose constellation
- Document how to run the Ci/CD tests that gitlab does, locally

## If you see something, say something

If you see possible improvements or doing things that are sub-optimial, but don't have time to fix it, just file a jira and move on.
